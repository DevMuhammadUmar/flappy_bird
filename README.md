Flappy Bird Clone (Flutter)

A simple, customizable **Flappy Bird** clone built with **Flutter**. This project demonstrates core game development concepts such as physics-based motion, dynamic barrier generation, and real-time collision detectionâ€”all within Flutter's widget system.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Smooth bird jump with gravity simulation
- Moving barriers with randomized heights
- Score and high score tracking
- Collision detection with obstacles and screen boundaries
- Tap to start and replay support
- Modular design with separate widgets for bird and barriers

## ðŸ§  Game Mechanics

- **Physics**: Bird jump follows a realistic curve: `y = -4.9tÂ² + 2.5t`
- **Scoring**: Score increases when the bird passes a barrierâ€™s center
- **Barriers**: Reset with randomized gap heights to create variety
- **Game Over**: Triggered by collisions or out-of-bound movement
